== Description

Galope is a general-purpose
http://forth-standard.org[Forth,role="external"] library. It started
in 2012 in order to compile Forth code that was common to several
Forth projects under development by the author, and also Forth code
that was generic enough to be useful in future projects.

Galope is focused on
http://gnu.org/software/gforth[Gforth,role="external"], but most of
its code is sytem-independent. In fact Galope has shared code with the
library of http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html[Solo
Forth], in both directions.

The home page of the project is
http://programandala.net/en.program.galope.html.

== Current status

As of 2020-11 Galope consists of 360 module files. Many of them
contain only one definition, even simple one-liner ones; others
contain whole tools.

Galope is used by most Forth projects of the author, but anything in
the library may be changed before its first public release.

The documentation is 80% finished. Its main part is a detailed
glossary, with full descriptions, usage
examples and cross references.  The manual (in EPUB, HTML and PDF)
is built from the source code by
http://programandala.net/en.program.glosara.html[Glosara].

== About the name

"Galope" stands for "Gforth Accessory Library Of Particular Elements".
In Spanish, "galope" is a noun that means "gallop"; in Esperanto,
"galope" is an adverb (the "-e" ending marks the adverbs in this
language) that means "at a gallop".  "Galope" is pronounced
identically in Spanish and Esperanto; its phonemic transcription using
the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is: /É¡a'lope/.

== Installation

In order to use the library, the path to its modules must be
accessible from your Forth system.

For Gforth, two methods are suggested:

One method is to add the Galope's source directory to Gforth's
`fpath`. Consult the documentation of Gforth.

A second method is to make a symbolic link to Galope's sources
directory from Gforth's <site-forth> directory. In a locally compiled
Gforth, the command on a Linux shell would be the following:

----
sudo ln -s ~/YOUR-PATH/ /usr/local/share/gforth/site-forth/galope
----

where "YOUR-PATH" must be replaced with the corresponding path to
Galope's sources directory on your system.

== The project repository

In order to preserve the evolution of the code and prepare the first
public release, a Git repository was created on 2016-06-21, out of
development and ordinary backups created since 2013 (one year after
the beginning of the project).

On 2020-11-29 the repository was converted from Git to
http://fossil-scm.org[Fossil]. GitHub will be used only as a mirror.
