== Description

Galope is a Forth library under development. It started in 2012 in
order to make the development of some Forth programs easier and
faster.

The library consists of more than 220 files. Many of them contain only
one definition; some of them contain whole tools.

Galope is focused on Gforth, but most of the code is
sytem-independent.

== The name

"Galope" stands for "Gforth Accessory Library of Particular Elements".
In Spanish, "galope" is a noun that means "gallop"; in Esperanto,
"galope" is an adverb (the "-e" ending marks the adverbs in this
language) that means "at a gallop".  "Galope" is pronounced as in
Spanish or Esperanto (its pronounciation is the same in both
languages).

== The Git repository

In order to resume the development and prepare the first public
release, a Git repository was created on 2016-06-21, out of
development and ordinary backups created since 2013 (one year after
the beginning of the project).
