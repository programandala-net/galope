\ author.

\ Warning: This code works because Gforth creates strings in the heap
\ (the dynamically allocated memory), that is not save in Forth system
\ images.

\ Notes:
\ The file <galope/constant_string_arrays_2.fs> has an improved
\ version that transparently compiles the strings.
\ The file <galope/semicolon-strings.fs> defines an alternative
\ ending.

: strings:  ( "name" -- dfa )
  \ Start the definition of a constant string array.
  \ The strings must be compiled with '2,'.
  create  here 
  does>   ( n -- ca len )
    ( n dfa ) swap 2 cells * + 2@
  ;
: /strings  ( dfa -- n )
  \ End the definition of a constant string array.
  \ dfa = data field address of the array, left by 'strings:'
  \ n = number of strings compiled in the array
  here swap - cell / 2/ 
  ;

false [if]
